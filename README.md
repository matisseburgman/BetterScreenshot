# BetterScreenshot



I made a simple native mac os app to edit the duration of the screenshot thumbnail and set the location for screenshots 

I hated how fast the thumbnail disappeared. So now I set the time to 20 seconds and I can make a screenshot and drag it to the app I need to put the screenshot in. No stress anymore! and no clutter on my desktop page!
